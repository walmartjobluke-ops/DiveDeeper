#Task 1: Identify the Greatest. Write a Python program that asks to enter three numbers. Code should then identify and print out the largest number among the three.
largenumber = int(input("Enter largest number: "))
middlenumber = int(input("Enter middle number: "))
smallnumber = int(input("Enter smallest number: "))
print("The largest number is: ") == print(largenumber)

#Task 2: Identify the Smallest Improve upon your code from Task 1 to also determine the smallest number among the three and print it out.
print("The smallest number is: ") == print(smallnumber)
