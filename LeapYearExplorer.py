#Task:1 Leap Year Checker. Write a Python program that prompts the user to input a year.
#The program should determine if the given year is a leap year or not and then display an appropriate message. Please note that this is the definition of a leap year: Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400.

year = int(input("Choose a year: "))
if year / 4 == int:
    print("True")
elif year / 400 == int:
    print("True")
elif year / 100 == int:
    print("False")
else:
    print("False")
